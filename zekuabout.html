    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>
        Zeku is the master of the Bushinryu style and also the "first" Strider of the Capcom universe. With that, he comes with two
        distinct play-styles that co-exist with each other: old and young. Old Zeku features his Strider style of combat,
        emcompassing more zoning tools, more defensive options, and ambiguous mixups, but having average to unimpressive
        normal moves. Young Zeku is the Bushinryu style of Zeku which comes with faster normals, fantastic and damaging hitconfirms,
        and scary okizeme. The caveat with this younger style is that he has no defensive options and reliable anti-air.
        Overall Zeku's two forms are extremely versatile, and it may seem overbearing at first, but once understanding his
        tools Zeku is a rewarding and powerful character to use.
